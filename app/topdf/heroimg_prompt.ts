Create a visually striking and thought-provoking square aspect ratio image suitable as a hero image for an "AI PDF Report Generator" focused on "PsychoVibe" (psychological insights).

Key Elements & Style:
-   **Central Focus:** A stylized, abstract representation of a human mind or consciousness. This could be achieved through interconnected neural pathways, glowing geometric shapes forming a head silhouette, or a brain-like structure made of light and data streams.
-   **AI Integration:** Subtly incorporate elements suggesting AI and data processing. This could be faint digital code overlays, flowing data particles, or a sleek, futuristic interface element interacting with the "mind" representation. Avoid overly literal robots.
-   **Psychological Insight Theme:** Convey depth, introspection, and revelation. Colors could be deep blues, purples, teals, with accents of a brighter, "insightful" color like gold, magenta, or vibrant cyan.
-   **Vibe:** Modern, slightly futuristic, intelligent, a bit mysterious but ultimately positive and empowering.
-   **Composition:** The central "mind" element should be prominent. Consider a background that is darker or more abstract to make the central figure pop. The design should be balanced and work well even if cropped slightly from the sides or top/bottom for different UI contexts (e.g., for a wide banner or a more square card).
-   **Details:** Clean lines, possibly some subtle glowing effects or particle systems. Avoid clutter.
-   **Text (Optional - if the AI can do it well, otherwise omit):** If text is added, it should be minimal and integrated into the design, perhaps "PsychoVibe AI" or "Unlock Your Insights" in a sleek, modern font. Prefer no text if it compromises the visual.

Output Format: Square image, high resolution.
