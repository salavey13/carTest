--- Task 1: Listening Matching ---

(Sound Cue: Optional short intro music/beep)

Narrator: Now we are ready to start.

Speaker A: I have many colourful stamps from different countries. My uncle travels a lot and always brings me new ones. I keep them in a special album. It's fascinating to see pictures of places far away.

(Pause 2-3 seconds)

Speaker B: My favourite thing to do is go to the park with my friends. We often ride our bikes or play football. When the weather is good, we can spend the whole afternoon outside. It's much better than sitting at home.

(Pause 2-3 seconds)

Speaker C: After school, I love to sit in my comfortable chair with a good story. Adventures, fantasy, detectives – I like them all! Books take me to different worlds and times. I visit the library every week.

(Pause 2-3 seconds)

Speaker D: My parents gave me a guitar for my birthday last year. I take lessons twice a week. It was difficult at first, but now I can play a few songs. My favourite is 'Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star'!

(Pause 2-3 seconds)

Speaker E: I find colours and shapes really interesting. I have pencils, crayons, and paints. I often draw animals or flowers. My art teacher says I am getting better and better. Maybe one day I'll be an artist.

Narrator: You have 15 seconds to complete the task. (Pause 15 seconds) Now you will hear the texts again.

(Pause 3 seconds before repeat)

London Attractions

London is the capital of Great Britain. It is a very big and exciting city with many interesting places to visit. One famous place is Buckingham Palace. This is where the Queen lives when she is in London. You can watch the Changing of the Guard ceremony there.

Another great place is the Tower of London. It is a very old castle by the River Thames. It has a long history and used to be a prison. Now, you can see the Crown Jewels there.

Don't forget to ride on the London Eye! It's a giant Ferris wheel that gives you amazing views of the city. You can see Big Ben and the Houses of Parliament from the top. London has something interesting for everyone.
