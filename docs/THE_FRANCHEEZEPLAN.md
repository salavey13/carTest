# THE_FRANCHEEZEPLAN

Status: `active-planning`  
Owner: `product + codex`  
Scope: Motorbike rental franchise-ready public UX (`/franchize/*`) with Pepperolli-inspired visual language.

## 0) Goal and operating mode

### Product goal
Create a reusable **franchise storefront runtime** for bike crews where one crew slug can hydrate:
- main catalog,
- item modal flow,
- cart,
- order page,
- about,
- contacts,
- branded header/footer/menu.

### Execution mode (MANDATORY)
- Tasks are executed **strictly one-by-one** (sequential), not in parallel.
- A task may start only when all dependencies are completed.
- The plan must remain extensible: new tasks can be appended at the end or inserted with explicit dependency notes.
- If dependencies are unclear, mark current task `blocked` and add prerequisite tasks first.

### Progress protocol (MANDATORY)
For every task below, keep these fields updated:
- `status`: `todo` | `in_progress` | `blocked` | `done`
- `updated_at`: ISO timestamp
- `owner`: agent/operator
- `notes`: short implementation delta
- `next_step`: immediate follow-up
- `risks`: blockers or assumptions

---

## 1) Plan modules

- Execution status board: `docs/THE_FRANCHEEZEPLAN_STATUS.MD`
- Historical diary/archive: `docs/THE_FRANCHEEZEPLAN_HISTORY_ARCHIVE.md`
- Visual system + implementation blueprint: `docs/THE_FRANCHEEZEPLAN_BLUEPRINT.md`

This root file stays intentionally compact so operators and agents can load it quickly in high-frequency loops.

## 2) Mini execution diary

- 2026-05-04 — Added support for metadata-driven franchize header logo routing via `header.logoHref` with default fallback to `/franchize/{slug}`; seeded `vip-bike` to land on `/vipbikerental` instead of catalog. Next step: expose `header.logoHref` in admin configurator UI for non-SQL operators.

## 3) Active implementation slices

### 2026-05-06 — Sale buy page VS + test-drive reservation

- `status`: done
- `updated_at`: 2026-05-06T00:00:00Z
- `owner`: codex
- `notes`: Implemented `/franchize/[slug]/market/[bike_id]/buy` inline VS comparison and switched sale XTR primary CTA to a small Telegram test-drive reservation invoice.
- `next_step`: Smoke-test `vip-bike` buy page in Telegram WebApp with a real Telegram user id and confirm invoice delivery UX.
- `risks`: Local build may still surface unrelated repository warnings; invoice delivery requires configured Telegram Bot/API secrets.

### 2026-05-06 — Sale buy polish follow-up

- `status`: done
- `updated_at`: 2026-05-06T00:00:00Z
- `owner`: codex
- `notes`: Aligned sale reservation CTA copy with the same 100-500 XTR formula used by backend invoices, centralized VS spec aliases, and split reservation/cart CTA state so secondary cart actions do not display invoice success.
- `next_step`: Verify production `vip-bike` sale bike with real catalog specs and Telegram WebApp invoice delivery.
- `risks`: Visual/live invoice verification still depends on reachable Supabase and Telegram bot credentials.
