If you want to be wealthy and happy the rest of your life, just learn this lesson well. Learn to work harder on yourself than you do on your job. I have found in my experience that income does not far exceed personal development. Now, sometimes income takes a lucky jump. But sure enough, unless you grow out where it is, it'll usually come back where you are. Life has strange ways. If somebody hands you a million dollars, best you become a millionaire quickly. So you get to keep the money. Otherwise, sure enough, it'll disappear. Somebody once said, if you took all the money in the world, divided it up equally among everybody, it would soon all be back in the same pockets. Success is something you attract, not something you pursue. So instead of going after it, you work on yourself, personal development, because True happiness is not contained in what you get. Happiness is contained in what you become.
Hey, everyone. Welcome back. Today, we're going to be doing a deep dive into... Podcast creation. Yeah. Specifically... Million dollar products. Million dollar products. And we're going to be looking at this guide called A Full Guide to Making Your First Profitable Product. Yes. Beginners, take notes, it said. Take notes, beginners. So this is really interesting because this guy kind of starts off with a very interesting premise you know it suggests that you may already have a million dollar idea just hiding in plain sight hmm right like think about think about all the skills you have the interests your passions maybe you've even got in your Google Drive yeah and your Google Drive there might be like a system that you you use that could be turned into a million-dollar product. So where do we even start? Yeah. Well, they start off by kind of challenging how we view product ideas. It argues that we've all interacted with a million-dollar products. It's just about recognizing the principles of what makes them successful so instead of stumbling upon like a magical idea it's about understanding that process and those winning principles go behind all the things we see so it's less about the idea itself and more about understand this yeah how to build a successful product okay that makes sense yeah can you give me an example yeah absolutely um think about like online courses. Okay. Right. They're valuable. They're structured, accessible, often just as valuable as traditional books. Right. But we don't often think of them in the same way. Yeah. And they can be very successful. Exactly. Exactly. So it's about realizing that maybe a great product isn't as complicated as we think. I see. I see. We think it has to be like, you know, some crazy new invention. Right. When actually it can be something much more straightforward. Exactly. And that actually leads into a key concept in this guide, which is the personal system product. Okay. So this is all about tapping into your unique approach to solving problems. The frameworks you've developed through your own experiences. So I'm intrigued. Tell me more about these personal systems. Well, think about it. Like, everybody develops these unique systems for getting things done. Yeah. Like, it could be your method for staying organized or a process you use for work, even, like, your approach to fitness or anything, really. Right. And this guide suggests that these are the gold mines we should be exploring. So instead of creating something totally new, we're leveraging our existing knowledge and our experience. Exactly. Yeah. And they even suggest that most products should ideally start as educational products where you're sharing your personal system. Right. And that way you're providing value, validating your idea. You're minimizing risk before diving into something too complex. Right. Right. You're testing the waters before you go all in. Okay. Can you give me an example of like a successful personal system product? Yeah, absolutely. Yeah. There's this product called Two Hour Writer. And it's not just about writing. It's about this creator's system for efficient content creation. And, you know, people are buying into that system as much as they're buying into the writing tips. So they're getting that shortcut to success. Yeah, exactly. By following a provenball. And I think this is really interesting. Okay. They actually say, nail down your marketing strategy before you even build the product. Whoa. Really? That's so interesting. Why would you focus on the marketing before the product is even ready?
Well, they're trying to help people avoid a very common pitfall, which is getting so caught up in building something that they forget about who they're building it for right right so it makes more sense to make sure you're building something people actually want total before you invest all the time and resources yeah nobody wants to build an amazing product that nobody buys exactly so how do we ensure we're on the right track how do we like you know how do we know yeah well they give a do we know? Yeah. Well, they give a process, you know, this guide. And basically the first step is identifying that burning problem that your target audience actually has. So you really need to understand your audience. I have to understand them deeply. Yeah. And their aspirations. What they want. Exactly. Okay. So you're not just building a product. You're building a solution that resonates with them. Cracking a solution. Okay, cool. So how do we translate all this into like something tangible? Right. Well, they dive into the landing page, which is often the first impression. Okay. Right. For your potential customers. Yeah. And the key here is it's not about listing a bunch of boring features. Right. It's about highlighting the transformation the customer desires. So it's about painting a picture of that end result. Exactly. Like the positive change they can expect. Yeah. Instead of saying, you know, five weeks of training, you might say, imagine feeling confident enough to, you know, wear a swimsuit at the beach in just five weeks. Yeah. It's like that's so much more powerful. It's about appealing to the emotions, right? Totally. And painting a picture of that desired outcome. Okay. Awesome. That's a great way to make it like relatable, you know? Right. And speaking of making things tangible, they also introduced the idea of launching with a minimum viable product or MVP. MVP. Tell me more about that. What is it? So basically an MVP is a version of your product that has just enough features to attract early customers and validate your idea. Right. It's like a sneak peek to get feedback and refine the product based on real world data. I see, I see. And they even talk about using pre-orders for this MVP. So you're launching before it's even like totally finished. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It might seem counterintuitive. Okay. But it's actually a really smart way to validate your idea and generate early revenue. And build excitement. And build excitement. Exactly. And it also kind of creates that urgency. Right. Plus you've got people who are like invested and waiting for the final product. Exactly. You're accountable. Yeah. Okay. That's smart. That's a really smart approach I like that it seems like this whole guide is really emphasizing action yeah over perfection iteration iteration like getting started and making improvements along the way done is better than perfect exactly okay awesome this is super fascinating I'm curious though like is there yeah are there different approaches we should be thinking about depending on, like, what kind of product we're creating? That's a great question. Yeah. I mean, there are lots of different ways to package and deliver your knowledge. OK. And they actually dive into several options. OK. I want to hear more about these different options. So when it comes to creating these personal system products, the guide kind of encourages us to think about those problems that we've solved in our own lives, like those aha moments where you figure, oh, this is a better way to do that. Right, right. Could be anything, you know, from like managing your inbox to like a meal prepping system. Okay, yeah. That saves you, you know, hours each week. It's like taking those everyday wins and turning them into something that can benefit others. Yeah. I like that. It's like we all have these hidden gems of knowledge just waiting to be shared. And they even talk about going through a process of experimentation with your own systems. Like let's say you're creating a fitness program. Okay.
You wouldn't just throw it out there without, like, testing it out on yourself. Right. Right? So use yourself as the first guinea pig. You know, refine the process as you go. That makes a lot of sense. It's not just creating a product. It's making sure it actually delivers on its promises. Right. And it adds, I think, a lot of authenticity and credibility. Absolutely. Like, I've used this and it works. Yeah. And by documenting your journey, you're actually gathering valuable content. Oh. And social proof you can use to market the product later. So it's like you're creating a story alongside the product that people can connect with. That's a great way to put it. Yeah. Now, once you actually have a system that's been tested, the next step is really about crafting that irresistible offer. Okay. Right? And again, it's not just about listing features. It goes back to, you know, highlighting that transformation the customer desires. So can you give an example of, like, how to present that transformation in a compelling way? Yeah. Think of it this way. Like, features are logical. Benefits are emotional. Okay. And people buy based on emotion. Right. So instead of saying, you know, this program has 10 modules, you might say something like, imagine waking up every morning feeling energized and confident, ready to tackle your day. That's so much better. Yeah. That's so much more impactful. It speaks to the outcome. Yeah. Not just the components. Okay, cool. So we've got our system. We've got our offer. We've tested it out ourselves. What's next? Then it's time to build that landing page. Okay. The guide actually gives a pretty clear structure for this to create a landing page that converts visitors into customers. Okay. You know, it emphasizes having a strong headline that grabs attention, a sub-headline that clarifies the offer. Right. And then a compelling lead section that really digs into the problem and the solution. So again, it sounds like that storytelling element is really crucial here. It is. got to connect with the audience right on that emotional level yeah you know address their pain points yeah and show them how this can help them it seems like this whole guide is about storytelling it is yeah you know from start to finish yeah and it makes sense because people connect with stories yeah it builds that trust okay so we've built our landing page. We're hopefully drawing people in. Now what? Remember that concept of launching with an MVP? Yeah. This is where it gets really interesting. Okay. They actually encourage you to launch even before the product's fully developed. Wait, really? But isn't that risky? Like, what if people aren't happy with it? It might seem counterintuitive. Yeah. But they suggest offering pre-orders for the MVP. Oh, OK. And that way you're validating the idea, generating revenue before you even finish development. So it's almost like a testing ground. It is. Yeah. Yeah. You get that feedback. Right. Make improvements based on what people are saying. Yeah. And you also create that sense of urgency and excitement. Right. Plus you've got those people who've already like bought in. Exactly. You're accountable. Then they're waiting. And they're waiting. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. I'm like really starting to see how this guide is all about action, you know, over perfection iteration. That's the key. Okay. This is, this is really fascinating. I'm wondering though, are there different like delivery methods we should be thinking about? Yeah, that's a great question. I mean, there's so many different ways to package and deliver your knowledge. Okay. And the guide explores a bunch of options. Oh, okay. Tell me more about those. Okay, so, like, what are some of those delivery methods? Like, is there one, like, magic bullet? Ah, well, if there was a magic bullet, we'd all be rich. Right. But the guide actually does go through some popular options, you know, like e-books, e-mail courses, online video courses, even membership communities. And they even talk about software as a service. Right.
But it really depends, you know, on your product, on your audience. What are your goals for this? Yeah. It's like choosing the right service. Right. But it really depends, you know, on your product, on your audience. What are your goals for this? Yeah. It's like choosing the right tool. Exactly. For the job. Exactly. You know, you wouldn't use a hammer to tighten a screw. Right. Right. So, for instance, like an e-book might be a great starting point. Yeah. It's relatively quick to create. Mm-hmm. You can test the waters, so to speak. Right. See if people are interested in what you have to say. Yeah. Whereas like an online course. Okay. You know, that's going to be a much more structured learning experience. Yeah. You can often charge more for that. Right. Membership communities. Yeah. Those seem really popular. Yeah. They're really big right now. Yeah. And, you know, that can be a great way to foster a sense of community. Yeah. Yeah. Over ongoing support. And also that recurring revenue is really appealing. Right, right. So it sounds like, you know, we have options. We've got options. We've got a lot of different options. Does the guide offer any suggestions on, like, you know, which path to take, how to decide? Yeah, so they actually encourage this evolutionary approach. Okay. You know, start with something simple, like maybe that e-book email course. And then as you gain experience, grow your audience. Right. Then you can expand into more complex offerings. Yeah. You're not like locking yourself in right from the beginning. You're letting it evolve. OK. And is there like anything else like besides the core content that we should be thinking about? Yeah. So they really emphasize adding value beyond just the information. Okay. So think about things like templates, worksheets, checklists, you know, things that help people actually implement what they're learning. So like giving them a toolkit. Yeah. To achieve that transformation we talked about. Exactly. It's not just about the information. It's about giving them the tools to get results. Okay. Awesome. And does the guide say anything about like collaboration? They do. They highlight the power of connecting with influencers or other experts in your field. You know, and collaborations can really expand your reach, you know, tap into new audiences. Yeah. Yeah. Build credibility for sure. So it's like combining forces to create something bigger than you could do alone. Exactly. Yeah. And that brings us to, you know, the final but very important point they make. Okay. Which is, you know, continuous improvement. The journey doesn't end with the launch. It's about constantly seeking feedback, analyzing data, refining your product based on what you learn. Okay. So it's not a set it and forget it kind of thing. No, it's an ongoing process. Right. Right. Okay. So, I mean, the key takeaway here is that building a million dollar product isn't just about having a brilliant idea. Right. It's about having a systematic approach to identifying problems. You know, crafting that irresistible offer. Yeah. Launching strategically and always looking for ways to improve. It's about that journey. Yeah. That's really cool. And the most exciting part is that anyone can do this. Right. Doesn't matter what your background is or what experience you have. Yeah. You have the potential to create something amazing. That is a great point to end on. Yeah. So as we wrap up this deep dive, here's something I want you to think about. What skill or interest do you have that you could turn into a personal system product? Yeah. What burning problem can you solve in your own unique way? Think about it. The potential is there. Maybe your million dollar idea is closer than you think. Thanks for joining us today. See you next time.
