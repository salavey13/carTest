# About Me

After 13 years as an "office plankton" working in C++ and Java on the same team, I was totally burned out—convinced I’d never enjoy programming again. Then I discovered modern web development and AI tools: TypeScript, React, Next.js, Supabase, Vercel, and especially the creative power of AI assistance. For the first time, I was coding for myself, at home, just for fun—and I couldn’t stop.

Over two years, I went from no-code (Framer!) to full-stack: building, connecting, and deploying real projects, learning context providers, Supabase, and Next.js app routing along the way. I used AI to generate and expand my projects, building bigger and more complex components, and even letting AI generate entire project boilerplates for me.

A year later, I’m still not a “successful freelancer” (client relations are hard if they aren’t DevOps-level themselves—$69 earned in a year, but a lot of learning!), but I’m a creator. My proudest project is **Cybervibe Studio**: a self-evolving Telegram Web App that fetches and concatenates files from its own GitHub repo as context for AI, enabling rapid creation of new features and even automated pull request creation. The platform now boasts ~300 generated files and over 450 pull requests, all managed through a hybrid of AI and human review—free, accessible (even with VPN/sanctions), and community-driven.

Lately, I’ve focused on building a personalized interexchange arbitrage app (for my first Framer client—who’s also a friend!). My guiding principle: vibe coding is underhyped. I believe in creative, AI-augmented coding for fun and real-world impact—beyond clients, beyond hype, beyond burnout.
