Let’s be real: I’m just a noob who met Qwen (a super-smart AI), and things got out of control. Before I knew it, this dashboard was born. It’s designed for people like me—noobs who want to look badass while managing their projects without breaking a sweat. So, if you’re here, congrats! You’re officially part of the "Noobs Who Keep The Fuck Up" club. 🎉

## 💾 Installation Made Easy with `installer.bat`

- Installs Git, Node.js, and Python (if not already installed).
- Sets up all required dependencies (`requirements.txt`).
- Clones the repository.
- Applies the latest ZIP updates and creates pull requests.
- Configures Vercel environment variables.
- Batch-uploads data to your Supabase database.

### How to Use `installer.bat`:
1. Download the latest version of `installer.bat` from [here](https://github.com/salavey13/cartest/blob/a6c4cf448e4ca8a11a9b727218fe479a35ed134f/installer.bat).
2. Run it as an administrator (right-click → "Run as Administrator").
3. Sit back, relax, and watch the magic happen. 🪄

## 📋 Detailed Instructions

### 1. **Installing Dependencies**

The `installer.bat` script will handle most of this for you, but if you’re feeling adventurous, here’s what’s happening under the hood:

- **Git & Node.js**: These are essential tools for version control and running JavaScript-based applications. The installer ensures they’re installed and ready to go.
- **Python**: Ensure Python 3.x is installed. If not, the installer will prompt you to download it.

### 2. **Running the Dashboard**

Once everything is installed, select **Dashboard** from the installer, use the desktop icon, or run the dashboard manually with:

```bash
python dashboard.py
```

You’ll be greeted with a sleek, dark-themed UI that guides you through the customization process.
