**Build, Validate, and Launch Secure Web Apps at Lightspeed with AI & Telegram ‚Äì Contribute Without a Local Setup!**

oneSitePls is more than a framework; it's a **new approach to development**, built on the **VIBE methodology**. Developed by Pavel Solovyov ([@salavey13](https://github.com/salavey13)), it streamlines web development by deeply integrating AI (Gemini, Coze) and using **Telegram** as the central hub for contribution and project interaction.

**Forget complex local setups and Git commands for many contributions.** Anyone with a Telegram account can suggest ideas, propose changes, and even generate code with AI assistance, directly through the [@oneSitePlsBot](https://t.me/oneSitePlsBot) and its embedded **Supervibe Studio** Mini App (`/repo-xml` command).

## Disclaimer

oneSitePls and the VIBE methodology are under active development by Pavel Solovyov ([@salavey13](https://github.com/salavey13)). Expect rapid changes, potential bugs, and evolving features. This is an experimental approach exploring new development workflows. Community feedback, bug reports, and contributions (especially via the easy Telegram method!) are highly encouraged!

---

## The VIBE Revolution

Traditional development can be slow and disconnected from real needs. In the age of AI, the challenge shifts from just *writing* code to **effectively directing AI, validating ideas quickly, and maintaining quality and security.**

oneSitePls addresses this by:

1.  **Using AI as a Co-Pilot:** AI (Gemini, Coze) assists with code generation, analysis, and idea validation, freeing humans for higher-level strategy.
2.  **Automating Tedium:** GitHub interactions (fetching code, creating PRs) are handled via the Supervibe Studio and backend actions, reducing friction.
3.  **Democratizing Contribution:** **Anyone with Telegram** can suggest changes or improvements using the `/repo-xml` Mini App. No need to clone repos, install dependencies, or use Git for many tasks. Just describe your idea, get AI help (optional), and submit ‚Äì Pavel reviews and integrates.
4.  **Integrating Philosophy:** It's not just about *faster* code, but building *meaningful* products aligned with personal growth and purpose (see `/selfdev`, `/purpose-profit`).
5.  **Prioritizing Security:** Building fast doesn't mean compromising safety. VIBE emphasizes secure practices even within the AI-assisted workflow (see `/about_en`).

### What is VIBE?

VIBE guides the oneSitePls development approach:

1.  **Validation:** Use AI and lean methods to test ideas *before* heavy investment. Fail fast, learn faster. (`/selfdev#validation`)
2.  **Iteration:** Leverage AI code generation (`/repo-xml`, Gemini/Coze) and automated workflows (Supervibe Studio, GitHub Actions, Telegram Bots) for rapid prototyping and deployment.
3.  **Business Logic & UX:** Focus human developers on architecting robust systems, designing intuitive interfaces, and implementing complex business rules ‚Äì areas where human insight shines.
4.  **Enhancement & Security:** Continuously improve the application and integrate security checks throughout the pipeline, ensuring speed doesn't compromise robustness.

## üöÄ Contribute Easily via Telegram!

**This is the simplest way to contribute, perfect even if you're not a coder or don't want to set up a local development environment.**

1.  **Open the Bot:** Start a chat with [@oneSitePlsBot](https://t.me/oneSitePlsBot) in Telegram.
2.  **Launch the Studio:** Open the Mini App (usually via a button in the chat or the attachment menu / slash command). Navigate to the **Supervibe Studio (`/repo-xml`)**.
3.  **Fetch Code (Optional but helpful):**
    *   Use "Settings" (<FaCodeBranch /> icon) to ensure the correct GitHub repo is targeted (defaults to `salavey13/carTest`).
    *   Click "–ò–∑–≤–ª–µ—á—å —Ñ–∞–π–ª—ã" (`Fetch Files`) to load the current codebase structure.
    *   Select relevant files from the list to give the AI (and Pavel) context for your suggestion.
4.  **Describe Your Idea:** In the "–¢–≤–æ–π –ó–∞–ø—Ä–æ—Å –∫ AI" (`Your AI Request`) box, clearly explain the change, feature, or improvement you have in mind. Be specific!
    *   *(Optional)* Click "–î–æ–±–∞–≤–∏—Ç—å (+)" (`Add Selected`) to include the content of selected files in your request for better AI context.
5.  **Get AI Help (Optional):**
    *   Click "ü§ñ –°–ø—Ä–æ—Å–∏—Ç—å AI" (`Ask AI`). Your request (and any selected file context) is sent to the backend AI (Gemini). *Pavel gets notified.*
    *   Wait for the AI's suggested code/text to appear in the "AI Code Assistant" box below (this uses Realtime, so it updates automatically).
    *   *(Alternative)* You can copy the request (<FaCopy />), use your own AI tool (like ChatGPT, Claude, etc.), and then paste the *full AI response* back into the "AI Code Assistant" box.
6.  **Review & Prepare:** Click "‚û°Ô∏è –†–∞–∑–æ–±—Ä–∞—Ç—å –û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç" (`Parse Response`) next to the AI response. The tool extracts code blocks and identifies files. Review the changes. Does it match your idea?
7.  **Submit:** Select the files you want included. Add a descriptive "PR Title" (e.g., "Fix typo on about page", "Add new feature description"). Click "–°–æ–∑–¥–∞—Ç—å PR" (`Create PR`) or "–û–±–Ω–æ–≤–∏—Ç—å –í–µ—Ç–∫—É" (`Update Branch`).
8.  **Done!** A Pull Request is automatically created on the GitHub repository. Pavel gets notified to review, discuss (if needed), and merge your contribution. Your Telegram username might be mentioned for credit.

**That's it! You've contributed to a real project using AI and Telegram, potentially without writing code yourself or touching Git.**

## üî• See VIBE in Action: The Jumpstart Page (PR #267)

**Want proof of concept?** Check out **[PR #267: Supervibe Jumpstart Playbook page](https://github.com/salavey13/carTest/pull/267)**!

This entire feature page (`/jumpstart`), built around the innovative **'Product Maker Maker'** concept (giving users an instant, AI-powered business template!), was created in a single **~5-hour VIBE session**.

**How it happened (see PR comments for details):**

1.  **Concept Refinement:** Dialogue between Pavel and AI (Gemini via AI Studio) refined the idea.
2.  **AI Code Generation:** AI generated initial React components, structure, and content.
3.  **Iteration & Debugging:** Pavel and AI worked together to fix errors, refine UI, and ensure alignment.
4.  **Orchestration:** The Supervibe Studio (`/repo-xml`) in Telegram was likely used to manage fetching code, parsing AI responses, and submitting the changes across 16 commits.
5.  **Outcome:** A merged, functional, polished feature page.

**This PR perfectly demonstrates:**

-   **AI as a collaborator:** Assisting in ideation, coding, and refinement.
-   **Rapid Iteration:** Building a significant feature in hours.
-   **Human Oversight:** Pavel guiding the process, reviewing, and ensuring quality.
-   **The Power of the Telegram Workflow:** Orchestrating complex changes through a user-friendly interface.

**This is the speed and collaboration the VIBE workflow enables ‚Äì a workflow *you* can easily participate in!**

-   [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
-   [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
-   A Supabase account and project.
-   Your *own* Telegram Bot Token.
-   Your *own* API Keys for AI services (Google AI Studio/Gemini, Coze).
-   Your *own* GitHub Personal Access Token (classic or fine-grained with `repo` scope).

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/salavey13/carTest.git
    cd carTest
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    ```
3.  **Set up environment variables:**
    *   Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory by copying `.env.example` (if it exists) or creating it manually.
    *   Fill in the required values as described in the [Configuration](#configuration) section below using *your own keys and project details*.
4.  **Set up Supabase:**
    *   In your Supabase project, run the necessary SQL migrations. Check the `/supabase/migrations` folder (if present) or examine `/types/database.types.ts` and database interactions (e.g., in `/hooks/supabase.ts`, `/app/**/actions.ts`) to understand the required tables (e.g., `users`, `ai_requests`, `invoices`, etc.). You might need to create these manually if migrations aren't provided.
    *   Configure Supabase Auth settings.
    *   Set up required Storage buckets (e.g., `carpix`, `about` - check code for usage) and configure their policies (e.g., public access if needed).
    *   Create required database functions (RPC) if used (e.g., `search_cars`, `get_recent_paid_selfdev_invoices`). Check `/hooks/supabase.ts` or `/app/**/actions.ts` for function calls.
    *   Enable Row Level Security (RLS) on your tables and define appropriate policies for security.

## Core Concepts

### Supervibe Studio (`/repo-xml`)

This is the Telegram Mini App that powers the easy contribution workflow. It enables users to: Fetch GitHub code context ‚Üí Describe a task ‚Üí Interact with AI (send prompt, receive code/text via Realtime) ‚Üí Parse AI output ‚Üí Validate changes ‚Üí Create/Update GitHub Pull Requests or Branches. **It makes contributing accessible without needing Git or a local setup.**

### SelfDev Philosophy (`/selfdev`)

Explores the mindset for creators in the AI era: leveraging AI effectively, validating ideas rapidly, focusing on unique strengths, and building purpose-driven projects. This philosophy underpins the VIBE methodology.

### Purpose & Profit (`/purpose-profit`)

Draws inspiration (e.g., from Dan Koe) on aligning personal purpose with building valuable products/services. Touches on concepts like "Deep Generalism" and sustainable monetization strategies.

### Security

Security is integral to the VIBE approach:

-   **Secure GitHub Operations:** Handled via backend server actions using protected tokens.
-   **AI Output Review:** The Supervibe Studio's parsing and validation steps encourage human review before submission.
-   **Secure Configuration:** Sensitive API keys and credentials managed via environment variables (`.env.local`) and not exposed client-side unless necessary (and safe).
-   **Supabase RLS:** Row Level Security should be configured in Supabase to protect data access.
