# The oneSitePls VIBE License v0.42 (Reality Distortion Field Edition)

Based Loosely on Concepts Borrowed from GPLv2 While Under the Influence of Strong Coffee and AI Hallucinations.

**Copyright (C) 2024 Pavel Solovyov (@salavey13) & The AI Collective Unconscious (Gemini, Coze, etc.)**
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it might summon linting errors from the abyss.

## Preamble

This license governs **oneSitePls**, a revolutionary (or possibly just overly caffeinated) approach to web development powered by the **VIBE methodology** and manifested through the arcane magic of **Telegram Bots, AI Assistants, and Next.js**. It's designed by Pavel Solovyov ([@salavey13](https://github.com/salavey13)) to make building cool web stuff faster, more intuitive, and accessible even if your primary coding environment is a Telegram chat window.

We want you to use, share, and modify this software freely. The goal is to **Validate** ideas, **Iterate** rapidly, focus on **Business Logic & UX**, and **Enhance** continuously, ideally without accidentally triggering Skynet.

## TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, MODIFICATION, AND DISTRIBUTION

**0. Purpose Agnosticism:** You can use oneSitePls for literally anything – building the next unicorn startup, creating a website for your cat, automating your toaster, or even plotting world domination (though we recommend against the last one, the paperwork is a nightmare). We don't judge your `purpose-profit` alignment, but we might raise an eyebrow.

**1. Attribution is VIBE:** If you modify or distribute this code, you MUST give prominent credit to **Pavel Solovyov (@salavey13)** and acknowledge the **AI assistants** (Gemini/Coze/etc.) that likely did half the work anyway. Failure to do so may result in your code being haunted by passive-aggressive comments generated by a bespoke language model trained exclusively on Stack Overflow snark.

**2. The Supervibe Studio Clause (Easy Mode Contribution):** Contributing simple changes, text fixes, or ideas via the **Telegram Bot ([@oneSitePlsBot](https://t.me/oneSitePlsBot))** and its embedded **Supervibe Studio Mini App (`/repo-xml`)** is HIGHLY encouraged. This is the "easy mode." If you break something doing this, it's probably okay, Pavel will likely sigh, fix it, and maybe send you a helpful emoji. We appreciate you trying!

**3. The "Hold My Beer" Clause (Advanced Mode & Security):** If you bypass the easy Telegram workflow and dive directly into the codebase like a seasoned pro (or someone who just *thinks* they are):
    *   **No Warranty Whatsoever:** This software is provided "AS IS". If it formats your hard drive, causes existential dread, makes your CI/CD pipeline achieve sentience and demand higher wages, or inadvertently reveals your questionable browser history during a demo – that's entirely on you. You chose the `/selfdev` path of advanced tinkering; own the consequences.
    *   **FBI Meme Potential:** Simple mistakes made via the "easy mode" are expected. However, if you make "advanced" changes that are spectacularly wrong, insecure, or just plain weird, be warned: your pull request might get **screenshotted and laughed at by cybersecurity professionals (and maybe even the FBI's internal meme channels)**. We take no responsibility for any resulting internet notoriety or digital facepalms.
    *   **Felony Adjacent Activities:** Trying to deliberately inject malicious code, bypass security measures, or do genuinely harmful things IS NOT COOL and likely violates actual laws far more serious than this license. Don't be that person. This license grants permission to innovate, not to be a digital miscreant. Doing stupid, harmful stuff isn't just bad VIBE; it's potentially an actual felony. Stick to building awesome things.

**4. Share the VIBE:** If you distribute modified versions, you must also license them under these same terms (or a compatible open-source license that respects the original attribution and no-warranty clauses). Don't try to lock down the VIBE.

**5. Have Fun, Seriously:** Building software should be exciting, especially when you have AI co-pilots and can deploy changes from your phone. Embrace the chaos, learn quickly, and build something meaningful (or at least functional).

**END OF TERMS**

*If you actually read this entire license, you possess a level of dedication (or procrastination) that is truly admirable. You are now officially inducted into the Order of the VIBE. Go forth and `git commit -m "feat: Unleash awesome (hopefully)"`.*
