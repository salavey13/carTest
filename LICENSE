                            Preamble

This license is designed to make sure that you, dear user, can use,
modify, and share this software without worrying about legal drama.
However, if you break it, don't blame us. We’re just here for the memes.

                             TERMS

0. You are free to use this software for any purpose, even evil ones.
   But if you use it for evil, we’ll judge you silently.

1. You may modify the source code, but you must include this license
   and give credit to SALAVEY13 and Qwen. If you don’t, we’ll haunt
   your dreams with ASCII art.

2. Distributing modified versions? Cool, but don’t pretend it’s yours.
   Plagiarism is so last decade.

3. No warranties. If this software deletes your files, crashes your
   computer, or summons Cthulhu, it’s not our fault. You’ve been warned.

4. Have fun! Life’s too short for boring software licenses.

                         END OF TERMS

If you’ve read this far, congratulations! You now know more about open-source
licensing than 99% of people. Go forth and spread the gospel of GPLv2!
